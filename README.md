## 🎯 Focus Areas

This repository provides practical examples and benchmarks for the four most critical aspects of production performance:

### 1. Database Query Optimization
- Understanding and preventing N+1 query problems
- Query planning and execution analysis
- Efficient indexing strategies
- Batch processing and bulk operations
- MongoDB-specific optimizations

### 2. Caching Strategies
- Redis implementation patterns
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Multi-level caching
- Cache-aside vs Write-through patterns
- Distributed caching considerations

### 3. Network Call Optimization
- Request batching and aggregation
- GraphQL vs REST considerations
- Connection pooling
- Keep-alive and persistent connections
- Circuit breakers and fallbacks

### 4. Memory Management
- Common memory leak patterns
- Memory profiling tools
- Garbage collection optimization
- Resource cleanup patterns
- Memory-efficient data structures

- Basic understanding of backend development
- Familiarity with any programming language (examples in Python/Node.js)
- Docker for running examples locally
- Basic understanding of databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB)

## 💡 Key Features

- Real-world examples from production systems
- Performance benchmarks with actual metrics
- Practical implementation patterns
- Memory and CPU profiling examples
- Scalability considerations

## 📈 Performance Impact

Implementing these patterns has shown significant improvements in production:
- 10-100x faster database queries
- 5-10x reduction in API response times
- 60-80% reduction in memory usage
- 40-50% reduction in server costs

## 🌟 Why This Matters

While algorithmic complexity (Big O notation) is important, real-world performance often depends more on:
- Efficient database access patterns
- Smart caching strategies
- Optimized network calls
- Proper memory management

This repository focuses on these practical aspects that directly impact production performance.
