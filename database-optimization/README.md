# Database Query Optimization

## Understanding N+1 Query Problems

The N+1 query problem is one of the most common performance killers in applications. It occurs when your code executes N additional queries for N records fetched in an initial query.

### Example of N+1 Problem

```python
# Bad Example - N+1 Problem
users = User.all()  # 1 query
for user in users:  # N queries
    print(user.posts.all())

# Good Example - Single Query with Join
users = User.all().prefetch_related('posts')
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Eager Loading
- Identify related data needed upfront
- Use appropriate ORM methods (`include`, `prefetch_related`, `joinedload`)
- Balance between over-fetching and under-fetching

### 2. Batch Processing
- Use bulk operations instead of individual queries
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Consider using cursors for real-time data

### 3. Proper Indexing
- Index frequently queried columns
- Consider composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Be aware of index maintenance overhead

### 4. Query Optimization Techniques
- Use EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Avoid SELECT *
- Use appropriate WHERE clauses
- Leverage database-specific features

## Common Pitfalls

1. Lazy Loading in Loops
2. Unnecessary Joins
3. Missing Indexes
4. Over-indexing
5. Not Using Query Caching

## Practical Examples

Check the following directories for language-specific implementations:
- `/python-examples`
- `/node-examples`
- `/java-examples`

## Tools and Resources

### Monitoring Tools
- New Relic
- DataDog
- pgHero
- MySQL Slow Query Log

### Query Analysis
- EXPLAIN
- Query Plan Visualizer
- Index Usage Statistics
